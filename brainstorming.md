Mobile Dev Brainstorming:

## Ideas
1. Church finding app
- This app would help the digital nomads find a new church when they go to a new place and help them search by locations, pastor, service time, etc.
2. Chat summary app
- The app summarizes the content of a chat with loads of messages into bullet-point takeaways using LLM.
3. Friend-finder app
- When you enter your information, this would help you find a friend who share similar traits with you in the neighborhood
4. Friendly antics app
- When you challenge a friend to a beef, you enter a ripoff match with him/her with audience watching online!

## Evaluation of Ideas
### Church Finder App
**Category**: religion, place finder
1. Mobile: 
- When we travel different countries or visit different places, it is easy to get lost. I personally had trouble finding churches when I go to new places as I find myself being unable to find churches offering service in the afternoon. Since many travelers and nomadic coders tend to plan things on the go, this app would be very useful for them to find churches last minute.
2. Story:
- The audience is niche but also powerful. If a person follows a certain denomination, it would be challenging for him/her to find the church under that particular sect. Also, not all churches maintain their website, so it may be hard to figure out what the church would be like merely from web search. 
3. Market:
- The market would be pretty niche. The users would be predominantly Christian digial nomads, backpackers, or workers who visit a place short-term.
4. Habit:
- The app would not form any habits because the purpose is to assist people with finding the churches they want or the pastors they want to follow.
5. Scope:
- The app itself would use the preexisting church APIs which contains information about the sect, pastor, location, and service time of churches in different regions. It would be totally doable to complete this in two weeks.
- The stripped-down version would still be interesting because there are no apps that serve such a niche market need.
- The product is overall well-defined.


### Friendly Antics App
**Category**: Social Networking
1. Mobile: 
- The app can use push notifications to let people know if there is a new response or for spectators, when there is a poll created
2. Story:
- It is bad to offend people, but we sometimes want some sarcasm in our lives. We rip each other off for antics. Standup comedians do that all the time. It may be fun to see how the dynamics of language works along the border of naughtiness to rudeness as spectators participate in the polls to show their approval or disapproval.
3. Market:
- The initial user base would be close friends and universities, but this can expand to a large match between standup comedians or even famous corporate officers (e.g. Mark Zuckerberg vs. Elon Musk)
4. Habit:  
- The app can be quite addictive if you like making fun of people
- It would be also quite addictive for spectators because some beef match can be quite a spectacle
- Especially if you watch beef between celebrities on Twitter...just saying
5. Scope:
- I have to manage the backend database as well as manage different chatrooms so it could be pretty challenging to build in two weeks
- The stripped-down version would be having a single chatroom with unlimited number of users, which would still potentially be interesting
- The product seems relatively well-defined.


Final Decision:
Make Church-Finder App
